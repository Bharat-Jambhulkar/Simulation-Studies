# Simulation Studies: Exploring Theory 

This repository contains folders and code related to statistical simulations that study an interesting theory.

The folder BIC Study contains code files that perform simulations to verify whether the probability of BIC selecting the true model approaches 1 as the sample size increases. Note that the code is computationally intensive.

The folder qq plot construction contains code to draw QQ plot for certain standard distributions.
